a.1. Compute the seasonal factors and day-by-day seasonally adjusted call volume.

a.2. Apply a last value model to a.1. Compute MAD and MSE.

a.3. Apply a 3-day moving average model to a.1. Compute MAD and MSE.

a.4. Apply a 5-day moving average model to a.1. Compute MAD and MSE.

a.5. Apply an exponential smoothing model to a.1. given alpha of 0.1. Compute MAD and MSE.

b.1. You have week 6 data, which has recomputed the seasonal factors. 

b.2. Recomputed day-by-day seasonally adjusted call volume use seasonal factors in b.1.

b.3. Apply an exponential smoothing model to b.2. given alpha of 0.3. Compute MAD and MSE.
